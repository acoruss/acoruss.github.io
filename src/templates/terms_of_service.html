        <p>Welcome to Acoruss. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
            Service.</p>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>Acoruss provides technology consulting, website development, custom software development, AI and automation
            solutions, and related services. All engagement details are outlined in project-specific proposals or
            agreements.</p>

        <h2>Discovery & Engagement</h2>
        <p>Our discovery process begins with a one-time fee of <strong>KSh 5,000</strong>, which is fully credited
            toward your project if you decide to proceed. This ensures both parties are committed to productive
            collaboration.</p>

        <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> 30% of the total project cost is required before work begins.</li>
            <li><strong>Milestone payments:</strong> Progress payments are tied to deliverable milestones as outlined in
                your project agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Final payment:</strong> The remaining balance is due upon project completion and handover.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Change Requests</h2>
        <p>Changes outside the original project scope will be quoted, approved, and billed separately. We ensure
            transparency so that you're never surprised by additional costs.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property & Ownership</h2>
        <p>Upon full payment, you own the final deliverables - code, designs, and assets - unless otherwise specified in
            your agreement. Acoruss retains the right to use general techniques and methodologies learned during the
            project.</p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>We treat all client information as confidential and will not disclose project details or business information
            to third parties without your consent.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>While we strive for excellence, Acoruss shall not be held liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
            damages arising from the use of our services or deliverables.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>Either party may terminate a project engagement with written notice. In the event of termination, payment is
            due for all work completed up to the termination date.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
