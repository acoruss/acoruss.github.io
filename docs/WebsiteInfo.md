# Our Services

Practical solutions designed to empower your business.

## Custom Software Development

We design and build software tailored to your needs. From web apps to internal systems, we create tools that scale, simplify operations, and deliver measurable results.

## AI & Automation Solutions

Harness AI and automation to save time, cut costs, and make smarter decisions. From chatbots to workflow automation, we deliver practical solutions that fit your processes.

## Technology Strategy & Consulting

Not sure where to start? We assess your current setup, identify gaps, and design a strategy that aligns with your goals—reducing risk, avoiding wasted spend, and building a competitive edge.

## Process Optimization & Cost Reduction

We analyze how you work and recommend tools, integrations, and workflows that make operations leaner. The result: lower overheads, faster delivery, and more time to focus on growth.

## Open Source Development

We create and share free, open-source SDKs and utilities. Clients benefit from reusable building blocks that lower project costs, speed delivery, and increase long-term confidence.

## Security & Trust Engineering

Find and reduce risk across apps, data, and cloud—**without slowing delivery**.

- Cloud & infrastructure reviews (IAM, network boundaries, secrets, posture)
- Access & data protection (RBAC/ABAC, least privilege, data classification)
- Secure SDLC (OWASP-aligned coding, code scanning, dependency health, CI/CD hardening, SBOM & signed releases)
- App/SDK security (auth flows, token handling, input validation, rate limiting)
- AI security reviews (prompt injection risks, data exfiltration, agent/model permissions)
- Threat modeling & remediation; coordinate third-party pentests on request

**Every engagement follows OWASP‑aligned practices, least‑privilege access, and CI/CD checks.**

# How We Work

A clear process that keeps projects secure, focused, and predictable.

**Step 1 – Reach Out**  
Tell us about your goals and context.

**Step 2 – Discovery Call (60 mins)**  
Deep-dive on needs, constraints, and success metrics.  
_A small discovery fee applies and is **fully credited** to your project if you proceed._

**Step 3 – Proposal & Engagement Plan (within 2 business days)**  
Scope & deliverables • Timeline & milestones • Pricing & payment schedule • Risks & mitigations (including security considerations)

**Step 4 – Kickoff**  
Finalize the **Statement of Work (SOW)**, invoice deposit, align communication rhythms, and confirm security baselines (access, data handling, roles).

**Step 5 – Build & Iterate**  
Short sprints with regular demos. Security is baked in: **OWASP-aligned coding**, dependency checks, CI/CD hardening.

**Step 6 – Delivery & Handover**  
UAT, documentation, training. Includes a security review of access policies, data handling, and maintenance expectations.

**Step 7 – Ongoing Support**

- **Maintenance** — updates, bug fixes, optimizations, and security patches for what we build.
- **Implementation** — executing consulting outcomes or rolling out new technologies with appropriate controls.
